# periodic CH solver

This is a collection of code for solving the Camassa-Holm equation on the periodic domain numerically. 

Please read the introduction to my dissertation at https://sites.google.com/view/jae-min-lee/home for an introduction to these equations and their importance.

Current usage:

Open main.py and enter relevant initial data and mesh resolutions

Run python main.py in a command line. Use Python 3.
